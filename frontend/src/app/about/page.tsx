      <p className={styles.paragraph}>
        ðŸ‘‹ Hey, we&apos;re the team behind Open Dev Net, a group of developers
        passionate about developing open-source software and building a
        community of developers. Thus, we decided to create Open Dev Net, a
        platform for developers to connect with other developers, find new
        opportunities, and streamline workflows.
      </p>
      <h2 className={styles.heading}>â›” The Problem</h2>
      <p className={styles.paragraph}>
        Currently, there are many platforms for developers to connect with other
        developers, but they are all closed-source and proprietary. This means
        that the code is not available for the public to view. This is a problem
        because the platform is not able to be audited by the community,
        therefore lacking privacy, security, and trust of the community.
      </p>
      <h2 className={styles.heading}>âœ… The Solution</h2>
      <p className={styles.paragraph}>
        We plan to solve this problem by creating an open-source platform for
        developers, that is privacy oriented, secure, and trustworthy. We will
        also be building a community of developers to help build the platform
        and make it better.
      </p>
      <h3 className={styles.subheading}>âœ¨ Open Source</h3>
      <p className={styles.paragraph}>
        As mentioned above, Open Dev Net is open-source. This means that the app
        is open for the public to view and audit. This also means that the app
        is free to use and modify. We believe that open-source is the future of
        software development, and we want to be a part of that future.
      </p>
